          The CoinAlpha design system provides a ready-to-use code framework
          which makes the UI development quick and consistent.
        </P>
        <br />
        <P>
          To avoid re-inventing the wheel, the CoinAlpha design system is built
          upon existing 3rd-party libraries to leverage the support of active
          communities that evolve independently and provide well-maintained
          documentation.

          <Bold>Tailwind CSS</Bold> is a utility-first framework which generates
          a set of utility classes based on design tokens from our Design System created in Figma.
          This provides a reliable set of standards to ensure consistency across all Hummingbot
          projects with the added benefit of a large active community as well
          as a great documentation site.
        </P>

        <P>
          <Bold>Twin.macro</Bold> allows us to use the generated utility classes inside
          JavaScript and ensures only the used classes are bundled with the final code.
        </P>
